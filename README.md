## ü§ñ About Bing Bot

Bing Bot is a GroupMe chat bot for H-Row's mascot, Bing. It responds to
different "commands" and sends unprompted messages throughout the day.

Bing Bot is a REST API built with the Python Flask framework and PostgreSQL,
hosted on Heroku.

## üè∞ System Architecture

There are 4 components that make Bing run:

- This code repository
- A GroupMe bot on the owner's GroupMe account
- A Heroku app (h-row-bing-bot)
- A PostgreSQL database (Heroku Postgres add-on)

There is arguably a 5th compoonent: [Kaffeine](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com)
pings the Heroku server every 30 minutes to keep the bot from idling during the
day. Kaffeine observes a "bedtime" between 6am-12pm GMT (1am-7am EST or 2am-8am
EDT) when it does not ping the server
[to keep the Heroko app in the free tier](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#quota).

When new code is pushed to the "main" branch of this repository, the Heroku app
is updated and re-deployed automatically. (Configured in Heroku settings)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to change Bing's settings

## üì≤ How to move Bing to a different chat

6. Copy the Bot ID, and paste it into the `GROUPME_BOT_ID` environment variable
   in Heroku ([details below](#-how-to-change-environment-variables-in-heroku))
