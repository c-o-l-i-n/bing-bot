## 🤖 About Bing Bot

Bing Bot is a GroupMe chat bot for H-Row's mascot, Bing. It responds to different "commands" and sends unprompted messages throughout the day.

Bing Bot is a REST API built with the Python Flask framework and PostgreSQL, hosted on Heroku.

There are 4 components that make Bing run:
- This code repository
- A GroupMe bot on the owner's GroupMe account
- A Heroku app (h-row-bing-bot)
- A PostgreSQL database (Heroku Postgres add-on)

When new code is pushed to the "main" branch of this repository, the Heroku app is updated and re-deployed automatically. (Configured in Heroku settings)
