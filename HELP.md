## ‚öôÔ∏è How to turn a command or unsolicited message on or off

1. Navigate to the Settings Google Sheet at [go.osu.edu/bingsettings](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
2. Check or uncheck the box next to any setting

## üôã How to change the name Bing calls someone

1. Navigate to the Settings Google Sheet at [go.osu.edu/bingsettings](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
2. Go to the "Nicknames" tab
3. Edit the text in the "Nickname" column

## üò® Bing's not working! What do I do??

1. Check if Bing is running by asking "Bing, are you alive?" or by visiting [this link](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
    - If Bing is not running, [log in](#-what-online-accounts-are-there) to pythonanywhere.com, and [extend Bing's life for 3 more months](#-every-3-months-bing-needs-rejuvenated), [reload the web app](#update-the-code-on-the-server), and try again.
2. Make sure the specific feature is turned on [in the settings Google Sheet](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
3. [Make sure Bing is in the right GroupMe chat and has the correct GroupMe Bot ID and Access Token](#-how-to-move-bing-to-a-new-chat)
4. [Check for errors in pythonanywhere](#-how-to-check-for-errors)
    - If you are getting an error like this, that means an [environment variable](#-environment-variables) is missing. Add it to [the `.env` file](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/.env?edit), then [reload the web app](#update-the-code-on-the-server)
      ```
        File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/os.py", line 679, in __getitem__
          raise KeyError(key) from None
      ***************************************************
      If you're seeing an import error and don't know why,
      we have a dedicated help page to help you debug: 
      https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/DebuggingImportError/
      ***************************************************
      ```
    - If there is a bug in the code, consider asking a CSE friend to help [update the code](#-how-to-update-bings-code)
5. If Bing said "my crayon broke :(" when trying to draw something:
    - Try again. Try again in a day or 2. If it still doesn't work, it likely means the API we use to generate images is no longer running, and we are out of luck :(
6. If Bing said "i'm not feeling inspired right now. maybe later" when trying to make a meme:
    - Try again. Try again in a day or 2. If it still doesn't work, it likely means an API or service we use to generate memes is no longer running, and we are out of luck :(
7. This one feature (or multiple features) never works anymore. What gives?
    - Bing relies upon many external services and APIs that are not under our control (especially pythonanywhere.com, the Google Sheets API, cron-job.org, and GroupMe). Any of these companies could choose to stop running their services at any time, and that part of Bing just wouldn't work anymore. All things must come to an end eventually :( It was fun while it lasted.
    - [Relevant Tom Scott video](https://youtu.be/BxV14h0kFs0)

## üò≥ I got a "Cronjob failed" email. What should I do?

We use `cron-job.org` to run code at a scheduled time, like Bing's unsolicited messages. If you get one of these emails, **you don't have to do anything**. It's just letting you know that the code failed to run.

If you want to investigate why it failed and try to fix it, [check the error logs](#-how-to-check-for-errors).

If there is an error like this when running the cron job `MEME`, just wait a day or 2. it likely means the site `api.allorigins.win` is down.
```
PIL.UnidentifiedImageError: cannot identify image file <_io.BytesIO object at 0x7fbd97939d10>
```

If there is an error like this when running the cron job `ELON`, same thing, just wait a day or 2. If it still doesn't work after a few days, it likely means Forbes changed the format of their website, and this message will no longer work going forward :(
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'text'
```

## üì≤ How to move Bing to a new chat

To move Bing to a new chat, you need register a GroupMe bot for that chat:

1. Log into [dev.groupme.com](https://dev.groupme.com)
2. Navigate to the [Bots page](https://dev.groupme.com/bots)
3. Click ["Create Bot"](https://dev.groupme.com/bots/new)
4. Fill in the details:
   - Choose the group this bot will live in: `(Current H-Row Chat)`
   - Name: `Bing`
   - Callback URL: `https://bingbot.pythonanywhere.com`
   - Avatar URL: `https://i.imgur.com/Kr6ti95.jpg`
5. Click "Submit"
6. Copy the Bot ID, and paste it into the `GroupMe Bot ID` field in the `Tech Config` tab of the [Settings Google Sheet](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
7. Click "Access Token" at the top right corner of the screen, copy it, and paste it into the `GroupMe Access Token` field in the `Tech Config` tab of the [Settings Google Sheet](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
8. Delete the bot from the old chat
9. __Important:__ Log into [Bing's Gmail account](#-what-online-accounts-are-there) and [change the forwarding address](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en) to your email so you will get alerts once every 3 months [when Bing's code is about to expire](#-every-3-months-bing-needs-rejuvenated), so you can prevent that from happening.

## üåÖ Every 3 Months, Bing Needs Rejuvenated

In free pythonanywhere accounts, [web apps are disabled after 3 months unless you click the "extend" button](https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/129/).

pythonanywhere will email hrow.bing.bot@gmail.com the link to keep things running 1 week before she is brutally murdered.

## ü™µ How to check for errors

[pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log) provides a few different log files. Scroll all the way to the bottom for the latest log entries:

- [Error log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.error.log) (the useful one)
- [Access log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.access.log)
- [Server log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.server.log)

## üëæ How to update Bing's code

You can technically just change the [code files directly on the server](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/src), but the "right way" is making the changes in git:

### Set up your development environment
1. `git clone https://github.com/c-o-l-i-n/bing-bot.git`
2. `cd bing-bot`
3. [Create the Python virtual environment and install dependencies](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments)
   - `python3 -m venv bing-env`
   - `source bing-env/bin/activate`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `touch credentials.json` to create the Google credientials file, then copy the contents from [the server](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/credentials.json?edit). 
5. `touch .env` to create the `.env` file, then add all [environment variables](#-environment-variables). Copy the contents from [the server](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/.env?edit), but these ones need to be different:
   - `PROXY_URL=''`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='/path/on/your/computer/to/credentials.json'`

### Make Code Changes

6. Make code changes
7. Test the code by running `python src/app.py`

### Commit Code Changes

8. `git commit` any changes to the `main` branch
9. `git push` the changes
    - When prompted to log into GitHub, use [Bing's GitHub account](#-what-online-accounts-are-there).

### Update the code on the server

10. [Log into pythonanywhere, and open a console.](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/consoles/)
11. Run the commands:
    - `cd /home/bingbot/bing-bot`
    - `git pull`
    - If you get a merge error/warning while pulling, run `git reset --hard origin/main` to force pull
12. Go to the [Web](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/webapps/#tab_id_bingbot_pythonanywhere_com) page
13. Click the reload button

![Reload button](assets/reload.jpg)

If you see this message at the bottom of the [server log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.server.log), that means Bing was started successfully.

```
spawned 2 offload threads for uWSGI worker 1
```

If you have no clue what any of that means, ask a CSE major to do it.

## üèî Environment Variables

These environment variables are require in pythonanywhere for Bing to work properly. They are set within the [`.env` file in the project root](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/.env?edit). After updating and saving the `.env` file, [reload the web app](#update-the-code-on-the-server) to apply the changes.

## üêç WSGI Configuration

Python web apps run on a [WSGI server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface). There is a configuration file in pythonanywhere located at [/var/www/bingbot_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/www/bingbot_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py?edit). It loads the environment variables from the `.env` file and imports the Flask app.

If something happens to that file, replace it with this, and then [reload the web app](#update-the-code-on-the-server):

```python
# load environment variables from .env file
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
project_folder = os.path.expanduser('/home/bingbot/bing-bot/')
load_dotenv(os.path.join(project_folder, '.env'))

# import Flask app
import sys
path = '/home/bingbot/bing-bot/src'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)
from app import app as application
```
