# üíª Tech Stuff for Nerds

## üèÉ How do I check if Bing is running?
Either send a message in the chat "Bing, are you alive?" and see if she responds, or visit the URL of her server: https://bingbot.pythonanywhere.com/

## üåê What online accounts are there?

- [Google Drive / Gmail / Google Cloud Platoform](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - Settings Google Sheet
  - Recieves emails
  - Google Sheets API & credentials from GCP
- [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/webapps/#tab_id_bingbot_pythonanywhere_com)
  - Hosts the Python code that runs the web server and daily scheduled task
- [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
  - Weather data API
- [Imgflip](https://imgflip.com/api)
  - Meme generator API
- [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
  - Triggers unsolicited messages throughout the day

The username/email for all accounts is `hrow.bing.bot@gmail.com`

The password for all accounts is (all lowercase) the nickname of the OSUMB, then the serial number on H-Caliber.

## ü™µ How do I check the error logs?

[pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log) provides a few different log files. Scroll all the way to the bottom for the latest log entries:

- [Error log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.error.log)
- [Server log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.server.log)
- [Access log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.access.log)

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Code Expiration

In free pythonanywhere accounts, [scheduled tasks (Bing's unsolicited messages) expire every 4 weeks, and web apps (Bing's command responses) expire every 3 months.](https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/129/)

  pythonanywhere will email Bing a link to keep things running a week before things expire. Bing's email currently forwards to me, Colin, so I'll probably click the link every time. If I don't click the link, there are buttons in the pythonanywhere dashboard that keep things running.

## ‚è∞ Scheduled Task Sketchiness

Unsolicited messages when using pythonanywhere (and other free hosting tools) are a bit sketchy because free accounts only let you have 1 daily scheduled task. I tried triggering every unsolicited message from a single Python scheduler file, but pythonanywhere only allows schedlued tasks to last up to 2 hours, which won't work if we want to run tasks the whole day.

__The plan:__
- [x] Set up a Flask endpoint to send an unsolicited message when hit
- [x] Hit that endpoint using cron jobs triggered by the free service cron-job.org
- [ ] Use my 1 daily Python scheduled task to change the cron-job.org cron jobs to random times
- [ ] Profit

## üèî Environment Variables

These environment variables are require in pythonanywhere for Bing to work properly. They are set within the [`.env` file in the project root](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/.env?edit).
