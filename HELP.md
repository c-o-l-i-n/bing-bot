## ‚öôÔ∏è How to turn a command or unsolicited message on or off

1. Navigate to the Settings Google Sheet at [go.osu.edu/bingsettings](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
2. Check or uncheck the box next to any setting

## üôã How to change the name Bing calls someone

2. Go to the "Nicknames" tab
3. Edit the text in the "Nickname" column

## üì≤ How to move Bing to a new chat

To move Bing to a new chat, you need register a GroupMe bot for that chat:

1. Log into [dev.groupme.com](https://dev.groupme.com)
2. Navigate to the [Bots page](https://dev.groupme.com/bots)
3. Click ["Create Bot"](https://dev.groupme.com/bots/new)
4. Fill in the details:
   - Choose the group this bot will live in: `(Current H-Row Chat)`
   - Name: `Bing`
   - Callback URL: `https://bingbot.pythonanywhere.com/bing`
   - Avatar URL: `https://i.groupme.com/422x422.jpeg.a071c9e4553d43559a4dcd3829001a8c`
5. Click "Submit"
6. Copy the Bot ID, and paste it into the `GroupMe Bot ID` field in the `Tech Config` tab of the [Settings Google Sheet](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
7. Click "Access Token" at the top right corner of the screen, copy it, and paste it into the `GroupMe Access Token` field in the `Tech Config` tab of the [Settings Google Sheet](https://go.osu.edu/bingsettings)
8. __Important:__ Log into [Bing's Gmail account](#-what-online-accounts-are-there) and [change the forwarding address](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en) to your email so you will get alerts once every 3 months [when Bing's code is about to expire](#Ô∏è-code-expiration), so you can prevent that from happening.

## üèÉ How to check if Bing is running
Either send a message in the chat "Bing, are you alive?" and see if she responds, or visit the URL of her server: https://bingbot.pythonanywhere.com/

# üíª Tech Stuff for Nerds

## üåê What online accounts are there?

- [Google Drive / Gmail / Google Cloud Platoform](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - Settings Google Sheet
  - Recieves emails
  - Google Sheets API & credentials from GCP
- [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/webapps/#tab_id_bingbot_pythonanywhere_com)
  - Hosts the Python code that runs the web server
- [GitHub](https://github.com/bing-bot)
  - To push code changes, use the `bing-bot` GitHub account. Colin (`c-o-l-i-n`) is the repo owner.
- [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)

The username/email for all accounts is `hrow.bing.bot@gmail.com`

The password for all accounts is (all lowercase) the nickname of the band, then the serial number on H-Caliber, then an exclamation point.

All accounts and services are free. Just make sure Bing doesn't die every 3 months:

## üåÖ Every 3 Months, Bing Needs Rejuvenated

In free pythonanywhere accounts, [web apps are disabled after 3 months unless you click the "extend" button](https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/129/).

pythonanywhere will email hrow.bing.bot@gmail.com the link to keep things running 1 week before she is brutally murdered.

## ü™µ How to check for errors

[pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log) provides a few different log files. Scroll all the way to the bottom for the latest log entries:

- [Error log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.error.log)
- [Server log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.server.log)
- [Access log](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/log/bingbot.pythonanywhere.com.access.log)

## üëæ How to update Bing's code

You can technically just change the [code files directly on the server](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/src), but the "right way" is making the changes in git:

### Set up your development environment
1. `git clone https://github.com/c-o-l-i-n/bing-bot.git`
2. `cd bing-bot`
3. [Create the Python virtual environment and install dependencies](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments)
   - `python3 -m venv bing-env`
   - `source bing-env/bin/activate`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up [the environment variables](#-environment-variables) for [your system](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html)

### Make Code Changes

5. Make code changes
6. Test the code by running `python src/app.py`

### Commit Code Changes

7. `git commit` any changes to the `main` branch
8. `git push` the changes
    - When prompted to log into GitHub, use [Bing's GitHub account](#-what-online-accounts-are-there).

### Update the code on the server

9.  [Log into pythonanywhere, and open a console.](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/consoles/)
10. Run the commands:
    - `cd bing-bot` (if not already in the bing-bot folder)
    - `git pull`
11. Go to the [Web](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/webapps/#tab_id_bingbot_pythonanywhere_com) page
12. Click the reload button

![Reload button](assets/reload.jpg)

If you don't know what any of that means, ask a CSE major to do it.

## üèî Environment Variables

These environment variables are require in pythonanywhere for Bing to work properly. They are set within the [`.env` file in the project root](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/home/bingbot/bing-bot/.env?edit). After updating and saving the `.env` file, [reload the web app](#update-the-code-on-the-server) to apply the changes.

## üêç WSGI Configuration

Python web apps run on a [WSGI server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface). There is a configuration file in pythonanywhere located at [/var/www/bingbot_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bingbot/files/var/www/bingbot_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py?edit). It loads the environment variables from the `.env` file and imports the Flask app.

If something happens to that file, replace it with this, and then [reload the web app](#update-the-code-on-the-server):

```python
# load environment variables from .env file
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
project_folder = os.path.expanduser('/home/bingbot/bing-bot/')
load_dotenv(os.path.join(project_folder, '.env'))

# import Flask app
import sys
path = '/home/bingbot/bing-bot/src'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)
from app import app as application
```
